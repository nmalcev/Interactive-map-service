# About
This repository containes the react application that provides an interactive map service.
The app uses the OpenStreetMap database provided by the online service https://photon.komoot.de/ to encode human-entered location names into geographic coordinates.


## Commands
- to install dependecies: `npm install`
- to start the application dev server: `npm run start`
- to build the release version: `npm run build` 


## How to use
After launching the application in a command shell, the user can interact with the application's user interface.  
The user must open the page `http://localhost:3000/` in a browser and enter any location/place name (e.g. musée d’orsay)
